## Exercises

### Exercise 1

The distribution is right-skewed, suggesting that most countries produce
less plastic waste per capita, and a few countries produce more waste.
Also, the disparity in plastic waste is large between countries.

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 51 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range
    ## (`stat_bin()`).

### Exercise 2

Because color and fill represent different variables, we want the color
to represent different continents in the dataset. Alpha is used to
represent the transparency of the data and does not indicate any
variables differences in the data.

``` r
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 51 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range
    ## (`stat_density()`).
